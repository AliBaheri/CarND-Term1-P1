Check out my write-up and results for this project [here on Medium](https://medium.com/@SealedSaint/detecting-lane-lines-udacity-sdcnd-b52bf36193cb).

Overview
---

The lines on the road show us where the lanes are and act as a constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

In this project I have created a pipeline to detect lane lines in images and videos using Python and OpenCV.


Getting Started
---

This project was derived from my fork of [Udactiy's Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit).

The starter and instrutions for getting started with my fork are [here](https://github.com/SealedSaint/CarND-Term1-Starter).
